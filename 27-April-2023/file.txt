1)Git
  I watched some more videos on git commands successfully created a branch
  and merge it with the main branch.

2) I went through the code base of ORAD project and checked out what are all the api's
   used. I didn't got the devomni access yet, so I'm unable to check how the code
   works in the frontend.
